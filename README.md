### Introduction

The goal of this workshop is to explore the simultaneous creation of audio and visual elements through the use of MIDI and the creation of sequencers created and piloted with ORCA in real-time. Orca will send signals to Unity and Live respectively and will power both sound and visuals.

### Motivation

I've always been interested in the link between audio and visual elements in performance, in illustrating the push and pull they exert on each other and developing fun ways of coupling and decoupling these two elements. Illustrating the creative process in real-time and experimenting live are also exciting areas of exploration, with [Algorave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave)  and the [Live Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding) scene being great examples of this. 

Which led me to think, _why not combine all the things?_
